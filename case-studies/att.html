    <h2>The problem</h2>
    <p>
      AT&amp;T’s Connected Solutions offering brought together multiple IoT capabilities—connectivity,
      management, visibility, and control—into a single platform. The value was real, but the story
      wasn’t obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
      For prospective customers, especially in the public sector, the problem was abstraction. “Unified IoT management” sounds fancy, but it doens't mean much to those outside the infotech space.
    </p>

    <h2>The challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Several constraints shaped the work: multiple stakeholder types, language that needed to
      withstand legal and regulatory review, and a product that solved systems problems rather
      than one-off pain points. The brief also needed to be scannable—not read linearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The risk was defaulting to familiar enterprise language without ever grounding it in real
      operational outcomes.
    </p>

    <h2>The approach</h2>
    <p>
      I focused on structure first, language second. Instead of leading with features, the brief
      was organized around what organizations need to do at scale: monitor assets, manage
      connectivity, reduce downtime, and make informed decisions across environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key decisions included translating capabilities into operational benefits, using plain language
      even when buzzwords were available, designing sections to stand alone for quick scanning,
      and leaving room for nuance rather than forcing certainty where it didn’t exist.
    </p>

    <h2>The outcome</h2>
    <p>
      The final brief functioned as a practical sales and enablement tool: something teams could
      share with stakeholders without needing to contextualize every paragraph. More importantly,
      it gave the product a story that reflected how enterprise buyers actually evaluate solutions—
      carefully, comparatively, and with an eye toward long-term operability.

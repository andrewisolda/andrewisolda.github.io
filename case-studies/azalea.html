    <h2>The problem</h2>
    <p>
      Azalea Health operates in a space where trust matters more than hype. As a healthcare
      technology company serving providers in rural and underserved communities, the brand
      needed to sound human without becoming sentimental—and confident without exaggeration.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the brand had a strong foundation, it was missing a central alignment—a shared understanding of how the brand
      should speak and act across touchpoints.
    </p>

    <h2>The role of narrative</h2>
    <p>
      The goal was to create a working document—something teams could reference, apply, and build from.
    </p>
    <p>
      The narrative needed to support marketing, sales, and internal communication equally well,
      which meant prioritizing clarity over flourish.
    </p>

    <h2>The framework</h2>
    <p>
      The final narrative focused on clear articulation of purpose and positioning, voice principles
      that guided tone and language choices, practical do’s and don’ts that made the voice
      actionable, and a structure that allowed the narrative to scale across formats.
    </p>
    <p>
      The emphasis was on utility: a brand voice that could be maintained consistently, even
      as teams and outputs changed.
    </p>

    <h2>The outcome</h2>
    <p>
      The result was a shared language for the brand—one that balanced empathy with
      professionalism and gave teams confidence in how to show up across channels. Instead of
      prescribing copy, the narrative provided a foundation for decision-making and acted as a starting point from which Azalea's internal creative team could build.

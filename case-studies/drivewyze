    <h2>The problem</h2>
    <p>
      Drivewyze needed a unifying campaign idea that could speak to multiple audiences with very
      different motivations—drivers focused on autonomy, businesses focused on efficiency, and
      agencies focused on compliance and safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      The challenge was to create a single idea flexible enough to scale, without losing coherence
      or credibility as it moved across channels and teams.
    </p>

    <h2>The insight</h2>
    <p>
      The strongest throughline across audiences was the idea of momentum.
      “Drive On” captured progress and confidence without overpromising, leaving room for practical benefits like time savings,
      smoother operations, and fewer interruptions.
    </p>

    <h2>The system</h2>
    <p>
      I translated the central idea into a usable system: messaging pillars tied to
      audience needs, tone guardrails that balanced freedom with responsibility, examples that
      demonstrated flexibility without dilution, and language rules that kept the idea from drifting
      into cliché.
    </p>
    <p>
      The emphasis on governance was intentional;I wanted to make sure the idea could
      survive handoffs, timelines, and scale.
    </p>

    <h2>The outcome</h2>
    <p>
      The result was a framework teams could execute confidently across channels without
      reinventing the story each time. Instead of a single campaign moment, “Drive On” became a
      durable platform for future work—consistent, adaptable, and easy to understand.
